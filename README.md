# Foolproof HTML editor prototype

The grand idea is to build a native html (so not a general text editor that's customized for html, but purpose built for only html) editor that can handle any html, even with random template code in the middle. Then hopefully expand the editing model to support css, then json and others.

I wrote a little article on the rationale here <https://pumpula.net/foolproof-html>

## Contributing

My prototype code is a mess, so we're trying to get some proper app arcitecture done. I set up a Gitter chat for planning and sharing stuff. The chat best way to contribute right now. https://gitter.im/flprf/Lobby

The prototype is good enough for demos, but not really usable yet. It's Mac only for now, mainly because doing good multi platform keyboard support would take time off from making it actually work. Contributions welcome!
